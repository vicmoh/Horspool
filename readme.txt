-------------------------<<((  How to Run the Program  ))>>-------------------------- 

- Go to directory
- Type "make" to compile
- Type "make run", if fail, type "./bin/run"

--------------------------------<<((  Assumptions  ))>>------------------------------ 

- Assumed that there can be multiple matches of a pattern on a single line
- For calculating execution time, the time rounds to the nearest millisecond, meaning in P12 it is often 0 or 1. 
- I calculate a total run time that adds up the execution times of the searches in P12.
- The reason brute force takes longer as the word becomes bigger is because it compares all 
the characters and doesn't break when one doesn't match (I believed this was a better representation of brute force)

Notes:

Amount of shifts:
- The amount of shifts in Boyer-Moore is always equal-to or less-than horspool
 (The more reoccuring patterns in the search word, the less shifts for Boyer-Moore)
- Brute force is always the max amount of shifts, as it moves by one each time

Ratios:
- The ratio for brute force is often higher because it is doing many smaller shifts 
per second, as it is only shifting by one position
- The ratio for horspool and Boyer-Moore are almost identical, they often only 
differ in execution time by a few miliseconds.

Size of search word:
- As the search word becomes bigger, brute force takes a longer time to execute and 
its amount of shifts decreases slightly
- As the search word becomes bigger, the run times for horspool and boyer-moore 
remain at a somewhat consistent valye between 25-40. The amount of shifts decreases in both cases though

Efficiency:
-Brute force is the most effective when the search word is very small (1 character)
-Horspool and Boyer-Moore become more efficient than Brute Force after the search word 
increases past size 1 and they stay consistant
